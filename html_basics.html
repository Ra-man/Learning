         the text, this can interfere with the design and acessibility so it isnt recommended to use.-->

            GIT CHEATSHEET
            Commands related to a remote repository:
            git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
            git push or git push origin main (Both accomplish the same goal in this context)
            Commands related to the workflow:
            git add .
            git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"
            Commands related to checking status or log history
            git status
            git log
            The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.

            For example,

            git add . is read as git | add | ., where the period represents everything in the current directory;
            git commit -m "message" is read as git | commit -m | "message"; and
            git status is read as git | status | (no destination).
